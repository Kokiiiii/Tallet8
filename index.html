    <p>The Tallet 8 is a housing complex built in Orestad (Copenhagen, Denmark) in 2010, overlooking the Copenhagen Canal. Shaped like the number eight, the Bjarke Ingels Group designed for complex for St. Frederikslund Holding with the intent to incorporate urban life with businesses, mimicking a mini-city with a city. The complex consists of 11 storeys, 60 000 sqm in area and 476 resident housings with continuous linking paths and cycling facilities.</p>
    <p>The project meets the definition of an urban transformation as it converts unused green space into sustainable and livable environments for its population, whilst also reflecting Orestad’s nature of being a developing city area. The design of the complex allows residents to access to natural needs such as sun, air and views, but also convenient access to trade and recreational activities (playgrounds and cycling paths).In essence, integrating necessary components of a sustainable, healthy environment into one. As it overlooks the Copenhagen Canal and Kalvebod Faelled’s protected zones, it preserves the previous environment yet also added a “green roof” to compliment its surroundings. Hence meeting the urban transformation definition, and also the succeeds Denmark's reputation as a highly livable “green” city.</p>

<p>Integration is a key move to the 8 Tallet project. Its main intent was to combine commercial trade and housing, transforming it a “mini-city” within the city of Denmark. As the project was delivered, it did succeed in creating an environment where retail, work, and other services were accessible within short travel time. Yet due to this, a counterargument is that it would constrict itself to expansion since there are limited space available for expansion. </p>

<p>Circulation is a key move and its main intent to to allow a connected space for easy access and stable human traffic flow. Judging from the amount of space provided and considerations taken during design, the key move would be a success, yet this is to be verified since the estate isn’t at full capacity. The counterpart would be it limits the travel choices as there would only be too few large entrances, exits and pathways for residents to traverse. </p>

<p>Heritage is a key move and its main intent is to preserve the surrounding environment. As the estate is surrounding by protected zones (Copenhagen Canal and Kalvebod Faelled), the designers incorporated considerate attention to the “green” aspect of modern design and to reflect Scandinavia's leading stance in being sustainable and green whilst complying with Denmark's environmental regulations. Yet a counterargument is that it limits expansion outwards. In economics to achieve economic growth, environmental sacrifice are necessary and vice versa, hence large protected arounds of unused large could block any potential future growth. </p>

    <p>Twist is a key move with its main purpose being a access and connection platform. Instead of being a conventional circle, it entanges and produces an eight shape, hence “8” Tallet. It serves as a connection bridge between layers to the opposite side, for example the residential to commercial or office to public spaces. It can be deemed a success as it was integrated into the design to create an easily accessible, sustainable and connected environment. Yet the counterpart would be the wastage of space internally. Potentially, conventional designs would maximise space, yet with the twist, it would decrease potential growth space internally as the building would difficulties expanding outwards.</p>

    <p>Layers is a key move and its design intent is for allocative purposes. The layers should determine the functions of the spaces in the area. It can be deemed as a success since it allows efficient and strategic planning with clear purpose indications. For example, Public Spaces could be placed closer to residential areas, whilst commercial spaces are placed further to prevent disturbance. The counterpart could be travelling between layers be difficult for the disabled, elderly or children since they are physically inept and would the assistance of costly eslators, lifts or access ramps would need to be installed to accommodate for needs. </p>

    <p>The transformation of a building can be assessed based of its statistics, revenue, population or nominations/awards. Hence aligned with its mission of urban development being a cohesive project between housing and commerce , the 8 Tallet had proven itself to be a successfully developed urban project, filling the needs of its residents. This can be proved true as the project was delivered and has received praise and awards for its innovative, sustainable design. These include: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>2011 World Architecture Festival, Housing Building of the Year</li>
      <li>Named one of the “10 Best Architecture Moments of 2001-2010” in the Huffington Post</li>
      <li>Received the award for best “Green roof in Scandinavia” by the Scandinavian Green Roof Association</li>
      <li>The 2012 American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture</li>
      <li>Was the recording grounds for the Movie, “ The infinite Happiness” by Ila Beka & Louise Lemoine</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br style="margin-bottom:200px;"/>
    

    <p>Yet through its academic and design success, whether it is an prosperous project can be proven otherwise. Judging from photographs of the project, the promised delivery was only demonstrated by a fraction. Further investigation on the real success would depend on:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The number of residents and businesses</li>
      <li>Revenue of the estate</li>
      <li>The population density of Copenhagen, and whether the population is inclined to move for better opportunities</li>
      <li>Whether the estate is well connected its neighbouring districts. (Transportation)</li>
      <li>The access to other services such as Airline and emergency services</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Favoured Stakeholders:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Bjarke Ingels Group</li>
      <li>Thomas Christoffersen (Partner)</li>
      <li>Store Frederikslund Holding,</li>
      <li>Høpfner A/S</li>
      <li>Danish Oil Company A/S</li>
      <li>Copenhagen City Government</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>The main reason to why the project was validated by city council and was commissioned by  Store Frederikslund Holding, Høpfner A/S and Danish Oil Company A/S was to make reflect Orestad’s growth and modernist nature. Presumably, the involvement of industrial companies suggests their promotion as environmentally conscience and upholding corporate social responsibility. Hence the Bjarke Ingels Group in partnership with Thomas Christoffersen was called to design a housing estate suitable for this characteristic, whilst taking account the modern residential needs for a citizen and embody ethical environmental practices.  </p>
    
    <br style="margin-bottom:200px;"/>
    
    <h4>Opposed Stakeholders:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Environmental Lobbyists</li>
      <li>General Public </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A potential reason why environmental Lobbyists may be against the project could be because it lays adjust to the protected areas of  the Copenhagen Canal and Kalvebod Faelled zones. This could large building cause large areas of shade which is detrimental to the surrounding grasslands and ecology. </p>
    <p>The second reason would be because of Orestad’s expansive nature. Due to the heavy focus on real estate and infrastructure, it has received much criticism of this.This focus has made the city amount desolate with large open built spaces. Hence city area itself hasn’t made itself particularly attractive for human settlement.</p>
